# Flokfugl Components Test Application

The purpose of this testing application is to proviode a clean environment for library components to be developed and tested. Any component that is exposed by one of this projects UI-related libraries, should get its own page here.

## Start the application

Run `npm run start:cmp:test` and go to [http://localhost:4500](http://localhost:4500). As this application is pulling the components right from the libraries sources, you are able to work on those components while having a clean test environment.
